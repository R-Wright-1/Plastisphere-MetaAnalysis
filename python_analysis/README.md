# Python/R analysis

Note that I am still working on this README, but it will provide details for carrying out the Python/R statistical analyses of the Plastisphere meta-analysis using the code in the ```code``` folder. It will be easier to do this by using the Rmarkdown file provided [on FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12923855).

Currently, the Python code is more or less as it should be, but I haven't worked on changing the R code and implementing this within Python yet (an older version did this, then I moved to Rmarkdown, and now I am putting it back into Python so that there is a script that will just ```run```.
