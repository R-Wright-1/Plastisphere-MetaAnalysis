# Python/R analysis

Note that I am still working on this README, but it will provide details for carrying out the Python/R statistical analyses of the Plastisphere meta-analysis using the code in the ```code``` folder. It will be easier to do this by using the Rmarkdown file provided [on FigShare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12923855).
