# Food or just a free ride? A meta-analysis reveals the global diversity of the Plastisphere


This repository contains instructions for reproducing the meta-analysis of Plastisphere studies performed in (with or without additional studies):
**Food or just a free ride? A meta-analysis reveals the global diversity of the Plastisphere**.

Please contact [Robyn Wright](mailto:robyn.wright@dal.ca) with any questions.

## There are two ways to do this:
1. I suggest that the easiest way to do this is by following the instructions in the .html file provided [in this Figshare file](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12923855). Within this figshare link there is also an [Rmarkdown file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) that has the instructions for reproducing the analyses and will allow you to run the code needed within this. If you are unfamiliar with Rmarkdown files, they allow you to run 'chunks' of code written in different languages within them, and this has therefore allowed all of the code used for the analysis to be included in a single document.

2. Alternatively, you could follow the code listed first for [the QIIME2 analysis]() and secondly the code listed for [the Python/R analysis]().
